<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->

<p>
This course will help you to use the computer more efficiently during your
research. We'll show you how to automate repetitive procedures like
manipulating files, computing statistics and creating charts from your data.
This will help you make your analyses less error prone and reproducible.
</p>
<p>
If you're eager to learn but you don't see the use of such skills in your
research, don't worry. The more you know, the more cases you'll see where you
can apply your newly acquired skills.
</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://etherpad.mozilla.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop (e.g.,
  '2015-06-10-esu'.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  Software Carpentry organization maintains a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>

<div id="shell"> <!-- Start of 'shell' section. -->
  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Download the Git for Windows
	<a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">installer</a>. Run the
        installer. <strong>Important: on the 6th page of the installation wizard (the
        page titled `Configuring the terminal emulator...`) select `Use Windows'
        default console window`. If you forgot to do this programs that you need
        for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the
        installer and select the appropriate option.</strong> This will provide you
        with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div> <!-- End of 'shell' section. -->

<div id="editor"> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.
  </p>
  <p class="unimportant">
    The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h4>Windows, Linux &amp; Mac</h4>
      <p>
          We recommend you to install <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> or
              <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> as your editor.

           the workshop will teach Python using something other than
           the IPython notebook.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 2.x and not version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 2.7 is fine but not 3.4).
      Python 3 introduced changes that will break some of the code we teach during the workshop.
    </p>

    <p class="unimportant">
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all <a
      href='http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility'>supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).

        We recommend the all-in-one scientific Python installer
        <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">Anaconda</a>.
        (Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't
        comfortable doing the installation yourself just
        download the installer and we'll help you at the workshop.)
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download the installer that matches your operating
          system and save it in your home folder.

          Open a terminal window.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
          tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
          appear.
        </li>
        <li>
          Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts.  When
          there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down
          arrow to move down through the text. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the
          default location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to prepend Anaconda to your <code>PATH</code>
          (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
